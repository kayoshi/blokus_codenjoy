      <h2>Object of the game</h2>
      <p>Each player has to fit as many of his/her pieces on the board as possible.</p>

      <h2>Game Play</h2>
      <p>Each player chooses a color and places that set of pieces in front of his/her side of the board. The order of play is as follows: blue, yellow, red, green.</p>
      <p>The first piece played by each player must cover a corner square.</p>

      <p>Each new piece must touch at least one other piece of the same color, but only at the corners. Pieces of the same color cannot be in contact along an edge.</p>

      <p>There are no restrictions on how many pieces of different colors may be in contact with each other.</p>

      <p>Once a piece has been placed on the board it cannot be moved during subsequent turns.</p>

      <h2>End of the game</h2>

      <p>The game ends when all players are blocked from laying down any more of their pieces. This also includes any players who may have placed all of their pieces on the board. Scores are tallied, and the player with the highest score is the winner.</p>
      <p>Each player then counts the number of unit squares in his/her remaining pieces (1 unit square = -1 point).</p>
      <p>A player earns +15 points if all his/her pieces have been placed on the board plus 5 additional bonus points if the last piece placed on the board was the smallest piece (one square).</p>
